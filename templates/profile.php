        Lain is a fourteen-year-old girl who uncovers her true nature through
        the series. She is first depicted as a shy junior high school student
        with few friends or interests. She later grows multiple bolder
        personalities, both in the physical world and the Wired, and starts
        making more friends. As the series progresses, she eventually comes to
        discover that she is, in reality, merely an autonomous, sentient
        computer program in the physical and corporeal form of a human being,
        designed to sever the invisible barrier between the Wired and the real
        world. In the end, Lain is challenged to accept herself as a de facto
        goddess for the Wired, having become an omnipotent and omnipresent
        virtual being with worshippers of her own, as well as an ability to
        exist beyond the borders of devices, time, or space.
